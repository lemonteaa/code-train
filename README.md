# Code Train

*Proof of Concept for an experimental, decentralized LMS (Learning Management System)*

See [the gist](https://gist.github.com/lemonteaa/7eff8f38362e63922272f50e136e43db) for the project plan/design document.

## Description

A web app that leverages [Stack/Hiro](https://www.hiro.so/) (formerly Blockstack), IPFS, and the [Hive blockchain](https://hive.io/) to implement some LMS functionalities without having to use a backend. (You can think of it as *borrowing other people's backend*)

Functions:

- [x] Course Reader
- [x] Course Catalog (Hive + elasticlunr.js)
- [x] Bookmarks
- [x] Daily Goal
- [ ] Cloud sync of user data
- [ ] Import/Export user data
- [ ] Notes + notes sharing
- [ ] Integrate with Akash to provide integrated "Cloud Shell"
